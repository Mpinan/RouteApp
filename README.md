# Route App

A humble route app that draws a route from point A to B, given an origin and a destination postcodes, using google maps API.

<p>
You can make a route just once, but also you are able to store and use them in the future.

## Tech Stack

- `React`
- `Express`
- `Bootstrap`
- `PostgreSQL`

## Planning

<p>
Initially I was just learning how to build a Back-end with Express and a database. I have expirience with PostgreSQL so I chose it to store accounts and routes since a relational database is better for this cases. Reading documentation, I was recommended to use MongoDB but due to some issues with my computer I had to work with PSQL.
<p>
When my back end was ready and working, I decided to add React and learn how they interact with each other. I found myself learning React and Express at the same time. This was perfect as I love how data interacts with each other in many ways.
<p>
I wanted to make something with tech I never used before and just convincing myself that I was able to do it. That it was working.
<p>
Unfortunatly, the app is not tested as it started as a mere practice. Still, I always approach it in the simplest way and break down every single step in order to achieve my goal.

## How to use

- Clone this repository.
- Once is cloned, in any order:
  - go to `/views` and install dependencies.
  - go to `/server` and install dependecies.
- Once the dependencies are installed, in the command line:
  - in `/views`, `npm start`.
  - in `/server`, `nodemon start`.
- The browser will open automatically with the app, if not, go to `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Create an account and try it.
